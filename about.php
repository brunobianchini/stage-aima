    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>AIMA expertise stems from the cyclotron laboratory of the Centre Antoine Lacassagne (CAL), that designed and built MEDICYC, the first hospital-based cyclotron facility in France for protontherapy. For more than 25 years, MEDICYC has successfully treated more than 7,500 patients. 

 

In 2009-2012, AIMA Developpement developped a new superconducting synchrocyclotron (S2C2™) for high energy (230 MeV) protontherapy of deep seated tumors. This conceptual design was adopted by the IBA Company, the world leading manufacturer of medical accelerators for protontherapy.

The prototype of the S2C2™ is installed in the cyclotron Laboratory of the Centre Antoine Lacassagne. Both MEDICYC and the S2C2™ will provide a world leading facility for the development of protontherapy. The dedicated R&D beam line has also been designed by AIMA.</p>
